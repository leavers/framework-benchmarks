# Framework Benchmarks

This project aims to perform performance tests on several common Python web frameworks and server deployment solutions, so as to have a more concrete understanding of the differences between different combinations.

There are currently three test items: a simple "Hello World" interface, querying data from a PostgreSQL database, and returning results after matrix operations based on numpy.
